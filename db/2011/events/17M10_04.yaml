abstract: 
  en: "During an hour of programming what do you learn about your performance? How did that last refactoring go? How does that hour compare to the previous hour? How about against last week or last month? How are your habits as a programmer improving? How does your refactoring pattern differ from a masters?

Professional Tennis players learn from detailed statistics about how they performed in a game and use this information to become better players.

Why don't we do the same in Programming? I want to demonstrate how we can, especially how we as individual programmers can help limit the time we spend in the red (failing tests). How long we spend in the red and how often can reflect on how we are working as programmers."
